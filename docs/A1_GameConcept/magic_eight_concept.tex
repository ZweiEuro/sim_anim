\section{Game Concept}

Here you describe the general idea of your game, its objective, the setup and content of the game field/scene as well as containing objects, items and controls.
If given, list references to games that inspire your game.

Show at least one figure of a schematic mockup (see Figure~\ref{fig:mockup}) that sufficiently visualizes the idea of the game, its major objects and items, and gameplay mechanism (hand drawn sketch is sufficient). 

\begin{figure*}[h]

\caption{Mockup of the game scene (source: ''Flight control``)}
\label{fig:mockup}
\end{figure*}

Use the bibliography in \emph{references.bib} to cite external sources, URLs, or related literature. This is how you cite a reference~\cite{McGuire2012}.

\section{Platform}

Here you specify the platform you intend to use. Web: which JS lib, etc. Standalone: which language and/or rendering framework. Use appropriate references.


\section{List of techniques}

Name the techniques you intend to implement, and a detailed description of how they add to the game. Are they an integral part of the game mechanics, or just decoration? Individual tech specifications can be accompanied by further figures.

Note: 2 techs per group member, at least 1 tech of class 1a -- 1d per member.

\subsection{Tech 1}

Specification. 

\subsection{Tech 2}

Specification

\subsection{Tech 3}
