	abstract = {This paper describes a novel filter for simulating motion blur phenomena in real time by applying ideas from offline stochastic reconstruction. The filter operates as a 2D post-process on a conventional framebuffer augmented with a screen-space velocity buffer. We demonstrate results on video game scenes rendered and reconstructed in real-time on NVIDIA GeForce 480 and Xbox 360 platforms, and show that the same filter can be applied to cinematic post-processing of offline-rendered images and real photographs. The technique is fast and robust enough that we deployed it in a production game engine used at Vicarious Visions.},
